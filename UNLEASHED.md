```

### R2

Canvas blobs stored as JSON at `canvases/{canvas_id}.json`

### API routes

```
# Workspaces

PATCH  /workspaces/:id              rename workspace
DELETE /workspaces/:id

# Canvases
POST   /canvases                    create canvas in a workspace
GET    /canvases/:id                load canvas
PUT    /canvases/:id                save canvas (debounced auto-save)

DELETE /canvases/:id

# Sharing (Pro only to create)
POST   /canvases/:id/share          generate share token
DELETE /canvases/:id/share          disable share link
GET    /share/:token                public read-only — no auth required

# Migration
POST   /migrate                     move localStorage canvases to cloud on first sign-in

# Stripe
POST   /stripe/webhook              handle subscription lifecycle events

# Clerk
POST   /clerk/webhook               user.created → provision free account in D1
```

## drawtool app changes (`apps/drawtool/`)

1. **Clerk provider** — wrap app, sign in / sign up button in Menu
2. **Migration prompt** — on first sign-in, if localStorage has canvases: modal asking to move them to cloud workspace
3. **Workspace + canvas switcher** — replaces the 1–9 slot UI for signed-in users; local slot UI remains for signed-out free users
4. **Auto-save** — debounced save to backend on canvas change (signed-in users)
5. **Share button** — Pro only; generates `drawzil.la/s/{token}`; read-only public viewer built into the app
6. **Fork** — any user visiting a share link can pull it into their workspace / local slots
7. **Export watermark** — on PNG and SVG export, if not Pro, stamp "Made with drawzil.la" in bottom-right corner before download
8. **Pro themes** — 2–3 themes gated behind subscription check

---

## Landing page (`apps/unleashed/`)

Simple marketing page at `unleash.drawzil.la`. Same stack: React 19 + Vite + Tailwind v4.

- Hero + feature highlights
- Pricing card (£2.99/mo)
- CTA → Stripe Checkout
- Stripe Customer Portal link for existing subscribers to manage / cancel
- `/privacy` — Privacy Policy (generated via Iubenda or Termly)
- `/terms` — Terms of Service (generated via Iubenda or Termly)
- No cookie banner needed if analytics-free; use Plausible (cookie-free) if analytics are added

---

## Stripe integration

- **Checkout** — subscription creation, redirect back to drawzil.la on success
- **Customer Portal** — self-serve cancel and payment update
- **Webhooks** handled in Worker:
  - `customer.subscription.updated` → update plan + status in D1
  - `customer.subscription.deleted` → set status to `cancelling`, set `cancel_at = now + 30 days`

---

## Cancellation flow

1. User cancels via Stripe Customer Portal
2. Webhook fires → D1: `status = cancelling`, `cancel_at = now + 30 days`
3. Full Pro access continues during grace period
4. Banner shown in app: *"Your subscription ends on {date}. Resubscribe or export your data."*
5. Cloudflare **Cron Trigger** runs daily:
   - Finds subscriptions where `cancel_at < now` and `status = cancelling`
   - Deletes all R2 blobs for that user's canvases
   - Deletes canvas, workspace, subscription rows from D1
   - Sets user `plan = free`
6. Resubscribing before `cancel_at` restores immediately — no data lost

---

## Share links

- Links are permanent — stay live as long as the canvas exists in R2
- No expiry on cancellation (canvas is deleted after 30-day grace, which kills the link naturally)
- Free users can fork a shared canvas into their own workspace / local slots

---

## Privacy & encryption

- Canvas data is **encrypted at rest** by Cloudflare R2 (AES-256) — standard infrastructure-level encryption
- drawzil.la staff can technically access canvas data as operator of the service, but do not do so except as required to operate it
- This is the same model used by Notion, Figma, and Linear — it is the industry standard for creative/productivity tools
- True end-to-end (client-side) encryption is deferred to v2; it requires key management that is non-trivial with Clerk-based auth

**Privacy policy wording (suggested):**
> "Your canvases are encrypted at rest on Cloudflare's infrastructure. We do not access your data except as required to operate the service."

---

## Deferred to v2

- Workspace / canvas thumbnails
- Real-time collaboration
- Password-protected share links
- Version history

---

## Build order (suggested)

1. **Backend repo** — D1 schema, R2 setup, core CRUD routes, Clerk webhook ✅
2. **Auth in drawtool** — Clerk provider, sign in/out, migration prompt
3. **Cloud save** — auto-save to backend, workspace/canvas switcher UI
4. **Stripe + landing page** — Checkout, webhook, plan gating in app
5. **Share links** — generate token, public viewer, fork flow
6. **Export watermark + Pro themes** — final polish

---

## Current status (handover)

### Done
- Full plan documented in this file
- `drawzilla-backend` repo scaffolded at `/Users/liam/Documents/dev/drawzilla-backend/`
  - Hono Workers app with all routes: `/workspaces`, `/canvases`, `/share`, `/migrate`, `/stripe/webhook`, `/clerk/webhook`
  - D1 schema in `migrations/0001_initial.sql`
  - Cron trigger in `src/index.ts` — runs daily at 2am UTC to clean up expired subscriptions
  - Type-checks clean, deps installed

### Next immediate steps
1. Run these from `drawzilla-backend/` to provision CF resources:
   ```bash
   pnpm wrangler login          # if not already logged in
   pnpm wrangler d1 create drawzilla-db          # paste returned database_id into wrangler.toml
   pnpm wrangler r2 bucket create drawzilla-canvases
   ```
2. Copy `.dev.vars.example` → `.dev.vars` and fill in Clerk + Stripe keys
3. `pnpm db:migrate:local` to apply schema locally
4. `pnpm dev` to run the Worker locally
5. Move on to **Step 2**: adding Clerk auth to `apps/drawtool/`

### Key decisions made
- Auth: Clerk (MAU-based billing, free to 10k MAU)
- Payments: Stripe (existing account, ~10% cut on £2.99)
- Infra: Cloudflare Workers + D1 + R2 (essentially free until meaningful scale)
- Cancellation: 30-day grace period, then data deleted by cron
- Share links: permanent (die naturally when data is deleted after grace period)
- Free signed-in users: 1 cloud workspace, can view/fork shares, cannot create share links
- Export: PNG/SVG with "Made with drawzil.la" watermark for free users, clean for Pro
- No cookie banner needed (Clerk + Stripe are necessary cookies only); Privacy Policy + ToS needed (use Iubenda or Termly)
- No real-time collaboration (deferred to v2)
